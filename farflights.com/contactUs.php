				<p>We are a group of IT students for <a href = "http://www.it-tallaght.ie"> Institute of Technology, Tallaght</a> who decided to produce a simple and fast website for searching the cheapest flights from Dublin.</p>
				
				<p>However our website approaches things differently from other websites like KAYAK and skyscanner.
				Instead of searching for a flight from other sources (which takes some time), our website only searches our own database for such flights which is almost instant. </p>

				<p>Our database gets updated every 24 hours to provide our users with the cheapest and up to date flights available.</p>

				<p>We are a small college group of few students and as of our limited resources we can only process a limited amount of information into our database. This process takes place on a small server, however our system is designed to be scalable so that with better hardware we can broaden the search parameters.</p>
